# Chinese-sentence-pair-modeling

This repository contains the following models for sentence pair modeling: **BiLSTM (max-pooling), BiGRU (element-wise product), BiLSTM (self-attention), ABCNN, RE2, ESIM, BiMPM, Siamese BERT, BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, DistilBERT and ALBERT.** All the codes are based on PyTorch and you are recommended to run them in Google Colab.

I conduct sentence pair modeling experiments on five Chinese datasets: three PI datasets and two NLI datasets.Table below gives a brief comparison of these datasets.
